hungry
“Hungry” is a free open-source software system that has GPLv3 public license.

There are a lot of similar projects that we can refer to but because we are developing a restaurant open-source project that is free and public we will start from scratch. Thus, we will just be taking ideas. 

1.	https://bahrain.kfc.me/
This system has a lot of functions that will be implemented in our project, such as sign-in, sign-out, adding a meal, removing a meal, etc.

2.	https://www.mcdelivery.com.bh/
The following website offers a function that our system will have which is ordering food. There is no need to call the restaurant to order food, as it will be included in the project.

The project was created for the ITCS333 course, and we decided that it would be better if we develop it into a free public version. The goal of the system is to save users’ time and effort instead of calling the restaurant every time. Also, the system will increase order processing performance due to its comprehensive cost-effective system. We provided documentation that lists the details they would like to look at to make a clear decision on whether to join the development team or not. Moreover, the project has followed the Attribute Driven Design (ADD) which is a methodology to create software architectures that consider the quality attributes of the software. This method will always facilitate the development stages.

Mission statement: The ability to use a single system that combines all restaurant functionalities. 


The project name is “Hungry” which stands for a hungry person that is willing to eat. The name is unique, short, and easy to memorize, unlike other systems that consist of many words that users may find confusing and hard to remember. We think it can be recognized over time.

Features:

•	Allow users to log in.

•	View the menu where all meals are listed.

•	Ordering food and tracking orders.

•	Generate reports and view information about meals.

•	Control and update users’ information such as passwords and addresses.

•	Search for a specific food or meal by browsing the categories or by entering its name in the search bar.

•	Pay online using a third-party payment provider for fines.

•	Receive receipt regarding payments.

•	The system must monitor all user’s movements to protect users’ private information.

•	The system must perform operations within a few seconds.

•	The user can use the system easily and efficiently. It doesn’t take time to get to know it.

Requirements:

•	The system will be developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. 

•	The system will be constructed with a highly secure design and must be able to accommodate the latest technologies.

Development Status 

The system's initial design has been accomplished. However, the project's implementation is in progress. The entire project will be attempted to be implemented by developers, who will then publish it to the project repository. Up to the completion of the project, each implemented function will be published in the repository.
 

Downloads 

The source code of the software should be visible to the contributors in standard formats. In our project, we use the PHP format in all our project documents. It was agreed that the standard build and installation procedures should be followed by the software. When we are packaging and releasing packages, each executable package should have a unique version number, and the website of the project should have two download links: one to download the application, and one for development purposes only.

Version Control and Bug Tracker Access 

Developers need to record changes to files over time so they can recall specific versions later. Because of that, we need to use a version control system to revert selected files back to the previous state. Developers want to compare changes over time and see the last modified files that might be causing a problem.  Change management and stability management are essential to run successful open-source software and by using VR we can handle these issues. 

We chose the Git version control system because it offers unlimited free hosting for our open-source project. Also, we keep all project sources that can be changed under the version control including designing documents, figures, requirement management plan, etc. This approach will facilitate making changes to the documents simply by submitting a commit. 

Additionally, we need to track bug reports and new feature requests. To do this we need to use a bug tracker (or issue in GitHub).   With issues we can: 

  * Track and prioritize our work using project boards. 

  * Track out-of-scope feedback from a comment in an issue or a pull request review. 

  * Help contributors open meaningful issues. 

  * Transfer open issues to other repositories. 

  * Pin important issues to make them easier to find (we can prevent duplicate issues to reduce noise). 



Communications Channels

Communication is essential in software development. Especially in distributed open-source teams, communication needs to be supported by channels including mailing lists, forums, issue trackers, and chat systems. Due to that, we have searched for available message forums to adopt it in our project. After studying the available options, we agreed to use Google Groups. We can email everyone in a group with a single email address. The spam-prevention and moderation features are very useful. Also, the scalability of this tool is pretty good. 

For virtual meetings, we choose MS Teams. It is extremely user-friendly and can facilitate a work environment between remote developers from around the world.

Developer Guidelines

*Code Samples:

As much as possible, code should be copy-paste runnable, which indicates that a reader should be able to run it by simply pasting a sample of it into a blank unit test.

code should be as simple as possible.
 
*Code Format:

Each line should have a single code command.

Each block of code should have a two-line margin from other code blocks.

Note: no need to do formatting manually. You can use the predefined formatter.
 
*Code-other notes:
The variable names should be meaningful and gives idea about the usage of the variable.

 
*Developers’ Interaction:
Developers should be communicating with each other through email or MS Teams.
 
*Bug Report:
Points to consider:

- Title: Keep it short and specific. Clearly summarize what the bug is.

- Summary: If title is not enough, include where, when and how the bug occurred.

- Visual proof: Screenshot or video helps the developer understand the problem faster.

- Expected vs actual result: Keep it short and specific.

- Steps to reproduce: Include the steps that created the bug.

- Environment: Include critical info like browser, operating system, screen size and zoom level.

- Console log: Identify the root of the problem.

- Source URL: To help developer spot the issue faster.

- Severity / priority: Impact level on your product / how fast it should be investigated.

- Advanced info: reporter name, assignee, due date, customer /user conversation.

Note: Do not make it harder to spot the issue by adding unhelpful information. Avoid duplicates.
