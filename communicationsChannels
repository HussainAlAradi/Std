Communications Channels

Communication is essential in software development. Especially in distributed open-source teams, communication needs to be supported by channels including mailing lists, 
forums, issue trackers, and chat systems. Due to that, we have searched for available message forums to adopt it in our project. After studying the available options,
we agreed to use Google Groups. We can email everyone in a group with a single email address. The spam-prevention and moderation features are very useful. 
Also, the scalability of this tool is pretty good.

For virtual meetings, we choose MS Teams. It is extremely user-friendly and can facilitate a work environment between remote developers from around the world.
